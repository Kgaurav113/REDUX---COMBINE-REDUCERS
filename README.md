# REDUX---COMBINE-REDUCERS
Update your TODO application
Update your TODO application

Part-I
persist data with local storage
create a login page, and use the reqres api to login and store token and authstate in localStorage
user if refreshed and already logged in should be shown the actual pages instead of login
use redux to maintain it
make the routes / and /login
Part-2
create an auth reducer
if the user is not logged in then do not show the todo and redirect them or use conditional formatting (no need to use API)
separate the reducer into a separate folder
keep the todo reducer into a separate folder
combine it with combineReducers
